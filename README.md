# p2p-file-distribution

A BitTorrent v1 client, implemented from the protocol specification in Go, with zero third-party runtime dependencies.

[![CI](https://github.com/asmanya/p2p-file-distribution/actions/workflows/ci.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/asmanya/p2p-file-distribution/actions/workflows/ci.yml)

## Demo

*(placeholder — demo GIF added once the client is feature-complete)*

## Quick start

*(placeholder — clone, build, run instructions added once the client is runnable)*

## Architecture

Seven layers, dependencies point downward only:

```
7 cmd/p2pget          CLI. Flags + wiring only. No logic.
6 internal/download   Orchestration. Only package with full system visibility.
5 internal/storage    Disk I/O, resume verification.
4 internal/tracker    HTTP announce. Does not talk to peers.
3 internal/peer       Wire protocol + connection lifecycle.
2 internal/piece      Geometry + SHA-1 verification. Pure, no I/O.
2 internal/metainfo   .torrent parsing + info hash. No network, no disk writes.
1 internal/bencode    Serialization. Zero knowledge of torrents.
```

Full rationale: `docs/architecture.md`.
